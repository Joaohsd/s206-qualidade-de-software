## **Starting UI tests with cypress**

## Overview

This document provides a brief introduction to Cypress, an open-source end-to-end testing framework for web applications. Cypress is known for its fast and reliable testing capabilities, making it a popular choice for developers and QA engineers.

## What is Cypress?

Cypress is a JavaScript-based testing framework designed to help you write and run end-to-end tests for your web applications. It allows you to simulate user interactions and test your application's functionality across different browsers.

## Key Features

### 1. Easy Setup

Cypress is easy to set up and get started with. You can install it via npm and be running tests in no time.

### 2. Real-Time Reloads

Cypress provides real-time reloads during test execution, allowing you to see your application's state as the tests run. This feature helps with debugging and identifying issues quickly.

### 3. Interactive Test Runner

The Cypress Test Runner is a user-friendly interface that makes it simple to write, organize, and debug tests. You can interact with your application while the tests are running, making debugging a breeze.

### 4. Cross-Browser Testing

Cypress supports cross-browser testing, allowing you to run your tests in different web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

### 5. Time-Travel Debugging

Cypress allows you to go back in time to see what your application looked like at a specific step in your test, which can be immensely helpful for diagnosing issues.
